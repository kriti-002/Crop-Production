# Crop Production in India 

This project provides extensive information on crop production in India over several years. The ultimate goal is to leverage the data to predict crop production using powerful machine learning techniques.

## Content

The content is sourced from the data.world website. You can find the dataset [here](https://data.world/thatzprem/agriculture-india).

## Inspiration

Predicting crop production in India is a crucial task with significant implications for the economy, food security, and policy-making. By developing accurate predictive models, we can help in planning and decision-making processes that affect millions of people.

## Dataset Details
